        <h5 class="title2">Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) topics are a core element of Audi’s corporate
            strategy. To create transparency and comparability across the automotive industry with regard to ESG
            performance, Audi was assessed for the second time by an internationally respected ESG rating process. The
            result: No other automotive company assessed by ISS ESG has achieved a better result to date for the 2023

        <p class="close">What did the analysts from the ISS ESG rating agency find particularly noteworthy with regard
            to sustainability and corporate governance?
        <div class="sub-close">
            <p class="sub-close"> > AUDI AG wants to achieve net carbon neutrality company-wide by 2050*. The ISS ESG
                analysts
                found that the company is using appropriate measures to achieve this objective. The company’s efforts in
                the
                area of alternative drive systems and mobility concepts are significantly above the industry average
                according to ISS ESG.</p>
            <p class="sub-close"> > Among others, the company offers all-electric and hybrid vehicles.</p>
            <p class="sub-close"> > In terms of vehicle life cycle analysis, the company is performing significantly above average
                compared with
                its competitors.</p>
            <p class="sub-close"> > According to ISS ESG, AUDI AG has extensively addressed the risks in the supply chain and the due
                diligence
                obligations in relation to responsible sourcing of raw materials from controversial sources and from
                high-risk countries. The rating agency therefore views the Four Rings as performing significantly above
                the
                industry average. This can also be seen from Audi’s performance in relation to sustainability standards
                in
                the supply chain.</p>
            <p class="sub-close"> > In the area of product safety (e.g. crash tests) and automotive cybersecurity, the ISS ESG analysts
                found
                that Audi vehicles guarantee a high level of occupant safety.</p>
            <p class="sub-close"> > Sustainability targets are built into the variable remuneration of members of Executive Management at
                Audi.
                In addition, Audi is also addressing the topic of corporate governance with a comprehensive code of
                conduct
                and compliance measures. </p>
        </div>
        <h4 class="eni">
            A good rating result is not just important for financial analysts and capital investors. Other stakeholders
            are now also placing increasing importance on good sustainability performance: for example, customers who
            want to buy vehicles with a clear conscience. Partner companies, applicants, employees and local residents
            also expect a company like Audi to fulfill its responsibilities with respect to sustainability.
        </h4>
        <h6 class="eni">
            The new rating result for 2024 reflects the company’s endeavors to make a valuable contribution to society
            and the environment in addition to its business performance. The goal is to minimize the impact on the
            environment and to influence society as positively as possible. For example, the company is working
            continuously to use resources as carefully as possible, to increase equal opportunities in the company and
            to improve working conditions in the supply chain.

            *Audi regards net carbon neutrality as a state in which, following the exhaustion of other possible measures
            aimed at reducing the still remaining CO₂ emissions caused by the products or activities of Audi and/or
            currently unavoidable CO₂ emissions within the scope of the supply chain, manufacturing and recycling of
            Audi vehicles, at least quantitative compensation is provided through voluntary and globally conducted
            compensation projects. This excludes CO₂ emissions produced throughout the utilization phase of a vehicle,
            meaning from the point when a vehicle is delivered to a customer.
